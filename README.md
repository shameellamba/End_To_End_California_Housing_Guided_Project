# End_To_End_California_Housing_Guided_Project
Here we will work on an end-to-end machine learning project. We will start from loading the data, visualizing it, fill in the missing values, create pipelines, handle categorical variables, train models based on that data, and finally predict using that model.  This will not only help you understand how to train a machine learning model, but will also give you a detailed idea of how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, train the model, and fine tune it in real life projects. A project from CLoudxLabs.
